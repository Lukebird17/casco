The functionality of the ATO will vary \ndepending upon the grade of automation. For GoA4 metros where no train operator is present, all functions performed by the train operator on a GoA1 \nmetro are performed by the ATO sub-system.  The ATO functions include: \n \nDriving the train from station to station obeying permanent and temporary speed restrictions within the movement authority provided by the ATP \n \nTrain door and platform screen door open and closing \n \nPlatform dwell time management \n \nApply applicable energy saving driving strategies  \n \nJog, realigning an incorrectly stopped train to within the specified ATP door opening tolerance. \n \nSelecting the appropriate driving profile for the line type, such as surface tunnel, wet etc. \n \nApplying platform hold, train hold and station skip commands \nSignalling and train control facilities in metro depots often are not provided, or they are very simple.   However, it is becoming common on modern metro \nsystems (and in particular on driverless/unattended metro systems) to deploy the same signalling solution in depots as on the rest of the line to provide \nATP and ATO functions.  This could include, for example: \n \nAutomatic routing of trains to and from storage tracks, to permit efficient scheduled and “on-demand” service build ups and reductions \n \nAutomatic close-up of trains on storage tracks \n \nAutomatic coupling and uncoupling of trains \n \nAutomatic cycling of trains through train inspection facilities or exterior car wash facilities."

      "answer": "根据提供的文档片段，直接描述《2024_Communications-Based Train Control》中图5.11所示的ATO子系统如何实现控制回路的具体细节的信息并不充分。然而，我可以基于这些片段提供一些一般性的分析和推理，希望能够帮助你理解ATO子系统的基本工作原理。\n\n### ATO子系统的控制回路实现\n\n#### 获取输入（Messglieder）\nATO子系统需要从多个来源获取输入信息以实现对列车的精确控制。根据《T_CAMET 04018.2-2019城市轨道交通 CBTC信号系统规范第2部分：ATO子系统》中的描述，ATO子系统的主要输入包括但不限于：\n- **列车当前位置**：通过车载传感器或地面应答器获取。\n- **速度信息**：包括列车当前速度和目标速度，通过速度传感器和轨旁设备传递。\n- **轨道状态**：例如道岔位置、轨道占用情况等，这些信息通常由ATP子系统提供。\n- **运营计划**：包括列车的运行时间表、停站时间等，由ATS（自动列车监控）系统提供。\n\n#### 形成车辆轨迹（Fahrzeugtrajektorie）\nATO子系统在获取了上述输入信息后，会根据这些信息计算出车辆的行驶轨迹。这一过程涉及：\n- **速度曲线计算**：基于列车当前的速度、位置以及前方的轨道状态，ATO子系统计算出速度曲线，确保列车能够安全、高效地运行。\n- **能效优化**：ATO子系统会应用能效驾驶策略，选择最合适的驾驶模式，如表面隧道、湿滑条件下的驾驶模式等，以减少能耗。\n- **停站精度控制**：ATO子系统通过精确的速度控制确保列车准确停靠在站台的指定位置，允许车门和平面屏蔽门的顺利开启和关闭。\n\n#### 将轨迹作为目标值传递给列车的控制设备（Steuergerät）\n计算出的行驶轨迹会被ATO子系统转换为目标值，这些目标值随后传递给列车的控制设备，具体包括：\n- **目标速度**：ATO子系统将计算出的速度曲线转化为目标速度，通过列车通信网络发送给列车的牵引和制动系统。\n- **目标位置**：列车需要到达的下一个站台位置或检查点位置，这些位置信息同样作为目标值发送给控制设备。\n- **驾驶命令**：如加速、减速、停车等具体驾驶操作命令，这些命令也是基于轨迹计算而来的。\n\n### 跨文档对比和推理\n虽然提供的文档片段没有直接提及《2024_Communications-Based Train Control》中图5.11的具体内容，但可以推测，ATO子系统的控制逻辑在不同标准和版本中保持了一定的一致性。例如，根据《T_CAMET 04018.2-2019城市轨道交通 CBTC信号系统规范第2部分：ATO子系统》的描述，ATO子系统在获取输入、计算行驶轨迹以及发送控制命令的过程中，强调了与ATP和ATS系统的紧密配合，这一点在《2024_Communications-Based Train Control》中也可能有所体现。\n\n### 结论\n尽管无法直接从提供的文档片段中找到《2024_Communications-Based Train Control》中图5.11的具体解释，但可以合理推测ATO子系统在实现控制回路时，遵循了类似的输入处理、轨迹计算和控制命令发送的流程。这些流程是ATO子系统实现自动列车运行的核心机制，旨在确保列车的安全、高效和准时运行。\n\n如果你需要更具体的信息，建议查阅《2024_Communications-Based Train Control》的完整内容，特别是图5.11及其相关描述。"
