A flexible, well-trained and motivated \nworkforce is key to a competitive and innovative \nsector.\nTo this end, several types of training will be proposed \nwith the establishment of a UIC Rail Academy \ndistance learning platform in partnership with a \nrecognised academic institution. This objective \nis to quickly offer the rail sector an express route \nto upskill staff, enabling them to confidently face \nthe challenges ahead. In this way, UIC wishes to \nextend the rail sector’s capacity for innovation and \nimprove the sector’s competitiveness by making \nfull use of the knowhow of its rail experts. UIC will \ngo on supporting regional training centres and \ncreate synergies between them in order to meet \nthe specific needs of members in the regions within \na common framework.\nFinally, the Talent and Expertise Development \nPlatform will see its organisation change in 2023 \nin order to address the new challenges and \nsolutions for learning, development and training \ntechnologies."
