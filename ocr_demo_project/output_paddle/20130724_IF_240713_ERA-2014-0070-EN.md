SUMMARY</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">A serious accident occurred at 20:41 hours on 24 July 2013, at PK 84+413 of line 082 from Coto da Torre branch (Ourense) to A Grandeira branch (A Coruña), kilometre point 85.0, near Santiago de Compostela station (A Coruña). This was due to derailment of all vehicles of long-distance passenger train 150/151, belonging to Renfe Operadora. This had come from Madrid-Chamartín and was bound for Ferrol.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The entire trainset was derailed causing catastrophic personal injuries and material damage. There were 80 fatalities and many seriously injured.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Conclusion: The cause of the accident was excessive speed of the train (travelling at 179 km/h) on the curve leading in to A Grandeira branch (the Angrois curve, speed limit 80 km/h). The driver was in breach of the requirements of the timetable of train 150/151 and of the Table of Maximum Speeds for line 082.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">As a contributory cause, it is noted that the driver&#x27;s attention was reduced when he answered a service telephone call on the train from the train manager, which caused him not to brake sufficiently to reduce speed before entering that curve.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Recommendations:</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center;'>Final addressee</td><td style='text-align: center;'>Number</td><td colspan="2">Recommendation</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center;'>Adif</td><td style='text-align: center;'>54/13-1</td><td colspan="2">Make it a rule that all speed reductions, from a certain deceleration onwards, must be marked at the trackside by fixed speed limit signs.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center;'>Adif</td><td style='text-align: center;'>54/13-2</td><td colspan="2">For these situations (significant speed reductions), arrange to set up balises progressively which may help to control the speed of trains, so that they brake in case the speed limit for entry into the block section is lowered. Therefore, implement the necessary ASFA Digital (Automatic Braking and Announcement of Signals) systems.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align: center;'>Renfe Operadora</td><td style='text-align: center;'>54/13-3.1</td><td colspan="2">Reinforce the procedures set in the Renfe Operadora SMS so that safety-related defects detected at any level are referred to the departments with the prescribed function of analysing and considering them, thereby assuring effective preventive management.</td></tr></table>

It was coming from Madrid-Chamartín and bound for Ferrol (A Coruña). After making a scheduled stop at Ourense station with changeover of driver, it continued on its route via line 082 (known as the Ourense - Santiago line). It departed from Ourense with a four minute delay.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The train covered the first 78 km of the line at an approximate speed of 200 km/h. The ASFA Digital system was working. All signals on its path indicated &#x27;track clear&#x27;.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">About 6000 m (PK 78+280) before the start of the curve leading to the A Grandeira branch (at PK 84+228, where speed of travel is restricted to 80 km/h), the driver answered a service call from the train manager (guard) on the corporate mobile telephone.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The trainset continued along track 1 and passed caution signal E&#x27;7 (PK 80+619) of the A Grandeira branch. After noting that the signal was indicating &#x27;track clear&#x27; to proceed on the main track, and at a speed close to 200 km/h, the driver continued the telephone call with the train manager. This probably distracted his attention, and he did not start braking in time to adjust to the prescribed speed for the radius 402 m curve located from PK 84+228.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td colspan="2">Page 10 of 110</td></tr></table>

Decision to open the investigation</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The Head of Accident Investigations of the Traffic Safety Directorate of Adif (the Spanish railway infrastructure administrative body) informed the secretary of the Railway Accident Investigation Commission (CIAF), by telephone call at 21:11 hours on 24 July 2013, that the accident now under investigation had occurred. He also sent SMS messages to the other CIAF staff at 21:18. At the same time the Ministry of Development Sub-Secretariat also telephoned the CIAF Chairman and Secretary to inform them of the event and its gravity. They both immediately set out for Santiago de Compostela. The Secretary arrived at the accident scene the same night. The Commission&#x27;s rail infrastructure expert joined him after midnight. They immediately began analysis of what had happened with Adif and Renfe Operadora staff. Early next morning, the CIAF Chairman and one of the technical investigators arrived at the scene of the accident and joined the team already at work. Article 21 et seq. of the Regulation on Traffic Safety on the Public Rail Network, which was approved by Royal Decree 810/2007 of 22 June 2007 (BOE No 162, of 7 July 2007), assign competence for the investigation of railway accidents and incidents to the Railway Accident Investigation Commission. In accordance with the provision of Article 21 of that Regulation, and as defined in Article 2, it is mandatory to investigate what has happened when the accident is serious. Under Article 23.1 of that Regulation, and in view of the exceptional features of this accident, the CIAF Chairman passed a resolution on 26 July 2013 appointing the CIAF Secretary as Chief Investigator. The Secretary, who has signed this report, then worked with the two investigators belonging to this Commission. The members of the investigating team were the Secretariat technician referred to, plus: - the Traffic Safety Director of Adif, who delivered his personal report on 6 November 2013, signed, with due authority, by the Sub-Director of Rolling Stock and Traffic Safety Management and the head of accident investigation; and - the Traffic Safety Director of Renfe Operadora, who delivered his personal report on 5 November 2013, signed jointly with the head of the accident technical investigation area. INECO, S.A., a publicly owned company, acting within the framework of an agreement for the provision of support in investigating railway accidents signed with the Sub-Secretariat of the Ministry of Development, has carried out work in support of the accident investigation on behalf of the chief investigator.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td colspan="2">Page 12 of 110</td></tr></table>

It had been during the arrival at Santiago. -He had no idea of the place where he had been on the route at the moment when the telephone call had been made. -It was clear that he was going to crash and he realised this at a distance, on seeing the curve. He knew he applied both brakes: electric and pneumatic. -The electric brake is the motor brake and the pneumatic brake is applied to the brake shoes. -Normally, for smoother braking, you brake with the electric brake and, if you need to brake a bit more, you apply the pneumatic brake a little. But if you need to brake much more, you put both brakes full on. -He has been on many journeys with this train manager, and he does the same routes that the train manager may go on. One day, he ends up with one, and another day, with somebody else. -He believes the train manager has done this route as much as he has, and he does it very often.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Answers to the public prosecutor&#x27;s questions -He has both the ATO system [a control for pre-setting speeds], which is a button, and the electric brake/power handle. In mid-position, the handle is at zero. Move it backwards, that is the electric brake; move it forwards, that is the power regulator. -Asked by the public prosecutor if he had to keep both hands constantly occupied, he answered: -No, he can keep his hands completely free. If he is driving on the pre-set speed system, he can keep both hands free. The only thing he cannot let go is the dead man. -He positions the corporate telephone in front of him [on the driving console]. He leaves the train logbook on a clip which holds it, and the iPad on a kind of screen which is not working, and he keeps it &#x27;enlarged so he can see it better, without having to peer. -Questioned by the public prosecutor about the reason for the train manager&#x27;s call, and whether entry on one track or another was up to him or to the control, he answered: -The train manager was asking him [the driver] whether the train would fit on the tracks at the station, because he [the driver] was aware of this information. And then the train manager, given this information, would call the management centre [at Renfe Operadora] to ask them to switch to one track or another.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td style='text-align: center;'>Page 33 of 110</td></tr></table>

If so, he requests a change of track, etc. Asked by the public prosecutor if the call to discuss this matter had to last nearly two minutes, and why the train manager did not make the call on arrival at Santiago, when the train was stopped, he replied that: - He had told the train manager that the train would fit perfectly at either platform, and the train manager had insisted. - He was bound to answer when the telephone rang, because the train might be on fire. - At that moment, he did not see the danger. He did not realise the point of reference [to start braking], because he did not see it. He thought it was not near and that he was going quite relaxed, at the right speed which posed no danger.

Normally, at Puentedeume, they enter on the main track and, on that track, passengers alighting from the train have to go to the end or beginning of the platform and cross the tracks, because there are crossings between the platforms, and go to the passenger building to get out on to the road which leads to the village of Puentedeume.- The family getting off at Puentedeume had not said anything to him. He had taken the initiative, in order to improve the service and convenience for the passengers.- He had already made such a call several times.- He always made calls of this type in similar situations. On some trains you can make them, on others you cannot [he means technically].- He does this if there are passengers. He always does it for passenger convenience.Asked by the public prosecutor: &#x27;did this conversation [the third], to tell him about the track you wanted, have to last one minute 42 seconds?&#x27; the train manager gave a confused account but implied that he did not know how long it had lasted, but that he had talked as necessary.Answers to the public prosecutor&#x27;s second set of questionsWhen asked by the public prosecutor: &#x27;had you stopped with this type of train at Puentedeume in the past?&#x27; he answered:- &#x27;Yes, but on the main track.&#x27;Asked by the public prosecutor: &#x27;can you explain to me why you make a call three km from Santiago to manage something [call the driver to see if he can stop on the bypass track at Puentedeume] which you could have done once the train had stopped at the halt in Santiago?&#x27;, he answered:- &#x27;I&#x27;m thinking about it now, I&#x27;m remembering now. What I know is that, from Santiago, I have no communication until A Coruña.&#x27;Asked by the public prosecutor: &#x27;but in Santiago you have it [he means coverage] to communicate all the matters which are considered essential once the train has stopped, don&#x27;t you?, he answered:- &#x27;At Santiago I have to control passenger access, boarding and alighting. When the train has stopped in Santiago, I have other duties to perform. Because, at this point, I have nothing to do, I call earlier&#x27; [he is referring to the moment at which he made the call before the accident].- &#x27;According to the regulations, I can call the driver to consult him about any service-related matter. It is not specifically regulated. We have some autonomy to pick the moment and the person who can answer our question.&#x27;- &#x27;I normally carry two telephones in case the battery runs out on me.

While it is not mandatory to have it in the cab, it complements the other: the Maximum Speed Table. This includes the maximum speeds per route (not per train), the permanent speed limits per track section, and other information.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The train logbook shows that braking availability was 200%, although 155% was necessary, and that the train was type 240 B (maximum speed for the type of rolling stock was 240 km/h, without considering other restrictions). On that day (24 July) a temporary speed limit of 200 km/h was in place, only on track 1. This had been imposed since 25 June 2012, between PK 77.6 and PK 80.1 of that line (082). There were no other recorded limits or restrictions.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The train timetable (book) for Alvia train 150/151 reflects that it had to stop for 10 minutes at Ourense station.

Between that point and PK 84+230, the maximum speed at which this train could travel (dictated by its own rolling stock) was 220 km/h. This point marked the beginning of the Angrois bend (the place of the accident), where the timetable shows a change of speed. This is limited to 80 km/h until the end of line 082 (A Grandeira branch km point 85.0).

From there to PK 6+094, maximum speed is limited to 235 km/h. From there to PK 84+230 (start of the Angrois bend and place of the accident), the maximum speed rises to 300 km/h, but is reduced to 80 on the next section to A Grandeira km point 85.0 (end of the line).

It sets a minimum number of checks of this type to carry out. For this purpose it provides Procedure SMS-PE-PCIA-01: Accompanied Train Journeys.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The aims of these checks are as follows:</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">- to check compliance with the regulations in force;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">- to detect incorrect or incomplete practices by driving staff;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">- to check correct fitting of safety devices on power cars;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">- during the accompanied journey, to observe the condition of the infrastructure and signalling equipment which may affect traffic safety;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">- to observe staff behaviour and psychological and physical conditions which may affect them; and</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">- to check the ergonomics of the vehicle and installations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The methods of inspection include checking train safety logs.

In the period from 10 December 2011 to 24 July 2013, on the Ourense-Santiago route, a total of 16 safety logs were analysed (equivalent to 1 411 km). 92 medium-distance train journeys were accompanied (equivalent to 8 114 km), and another 35 long-distance (equivalent to 3 087 km).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">According to certificates produced by these two departments, the inspections accomplished during the stated period found no defect on the permanent way between Ourense and Santiago de Compostela stations, on the 10 km up to the point of the derailment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Annex 3.2.3.3.4 reproduces those Renfe Operadora certificates.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">3.2.3.3.5.

The form includes details to identify where the incident occurred (train no, line, kilometre point etc.), description of the facts, measures adopted etc.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The Renfe Operadora Safety Management System includes the General Defect Management Procedure (SMS-PG-16), which deals with defects forwarded by operating staff, on PAIs, as one of the channels of communication of defects. The other channels it lists are: inspections; rolling stock defect logs; and notifications by external personnel to the company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Form PAI is normally in paper form. It is passed to the driver&#x27;s next in line, who processes it and forwards it for action, depending on the type of incident. Nevertheless, to help to make the information in the PAIs known as quickly as possible, a computer application has recently been developed. This makes it possible to e-mail the PAI to various addressees (not only the next in line).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Accordingly, CIAF investigators reviewed the PAIs in both paper and electronic format, originating from the North West Management and collected by the León Regional Delegation of the Traffic Safety Directorate. They also reviewed reports made by other personnel and forwarded to that centre by other means (memoranda, e-mails, telephone calls etc).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">They reviewed a total of 21 reports, 4 of which were by PAI, for the whole of 2011.

He attached a report entitled &#x27;Defects in the ERTMS/ETCS changeover from Level 1 to Level 0 and peculiarities on the AV 082 line.&#x27; Extracts from the comments in his report appear below:  - &#x27;Given the way the changeover from ERTMS to ASFA has been arranged, if the driver does not reduce speed to 200 km/h on his own initiative before PK 77+600, ASFA switches on (at this point) in emergency mode. It is therefore urgently necessary to set back the entry to ASFA (from PK 77+600, where it currently is, to PK 79+500, the point where the changeover from ERTMS to ASFA takes place) or move the curve for reduction of speed to 200 km/h (from PK 79+500 to PK 77+600) sufficiently far forward to avoid triggering the ASFA emergency if the driver does not reduce speed to 200 km/h at this time, because he has some other priority task to carry out.&#x27;  - &#x27;Another peculiarity of line 082 (in the &#x27;odd&#x27; direction, i.e. Ourense-Santiago) is a sudden change of speed downwards, for infrastructure reasons, from 300 km/h (200 km/h for Class 121) to 80 km/h. There is no advance notice of this from the trackside signalling, and no ERTMS cover, since trains are already running on ASFA. It seems important to study the possibility of requesting trackside installation of permanent 80 km/h speed limit signs, which could facilitate compliance with the maximum speeds.&#x27;  The first comment therefore describes a defect in the changeover from ERTMS to ASFA, bound for Santiago, before the Angrois (or A Grandeira) bend. The second is a warning that this curve is dangerous.  JM1&#x27;s four colleagues have made statements that they received his e-mail and did not forward it. They gave training to middle-distance drivers, with special advice on the speed transitions for the Angrois bend and elsewhere.  - On 27 December 2011 JP1 e-mailed documentation for the fifth meeting of the monitoring group for Class 121 rolling stock in operation in Galicia, Aragón and Catalunya, to be held in Madrid on 28 November 2011. He submitted it to three officers of Renfe Operadora who usually attended these meetings with him.  The points contained in that e-mail included that referred by JM1: the defect in the changeover from ERTMS to ASFA and the warning about the Angrois bend.  - On 28 December 2011 the Madrid meeting took place. Nine people were present: five from Renfe Operadora, two from Integria and two from Actren, the maintenance contractor in which CAF and Renfe Operadora have participating interests.  Agenda point 11 referred to &#x27;Adaptation of the braking curve (&lt; 200 km/h) for an adequate changeover from ETCS/ERTMS to ASFA&#x27;. It mentioned the defect detected by JM1 and described in his e-mail on the changeover from ERTMS to ASFA.  The minutes for agenda point 11 read as follows: &#x27;Renfe has forwarded the detected problems to Adif for assessment. Solutions are being studied jointly.

Given that the change of speed was in line with the regulations in force, they decided to intensify the training of all drivers, in the form of intermediate medium-distance driving assignments [JP1 corroborates this in his statement]. Similarly, during the accompanied runs in the cab and advice, driving staff were warned about the peculiar features of the line, to boost safety&#x27;.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The following is emphasised from the statements of the three Renfe Operadora officers who received JP1&#x27;s e-mail, and who usually attended these meetings: the subject of the sudden change of speed on the Angrois bend was not dealt with at that, or any subsequent, meeting. They only dealt with train maintenance and overhaul issues.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">On 26 January 2012 the sixth meeting of the group monitoring the Class 121s in operation in Galicia, Aragón and Catalunya was held in Madrid. Point 6 of the minutes deals with &#x27;Braking curve for the changeover from ERTMS to ASFA&#x27;. This corresponded to the subject dealt with in point 11 of the fifth meeting. The minutes record, among other things, that there was no change in the situation since the previous meeting, i.e. there had been no progress in resolving the defect in passing from ERTMS to ASFA. There was no mention of the warning of the danger of the Angrois bend.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">That same day, 26 January 2012, according to JM1&#x27;s second statement, he submitted to a member of the Passenger Traffic Safety Management of Renfe Operadora (Mr GS1) the content of the above-mentioned document &#x27;Defects in the ERTMS/ETCS changeover from Level 1 to Level 0 and peculiarities on the AV 082 line.&#x27; This included the warning of the danger of the Angrois bend. He also says he had experienced computer problems which prevented him from viewing this file.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">GS1, in his statement, claims that he has no record of receiving this e-mail. His line manager, the Passenger Traffic Safety Manager of Renfe Operadora, states that he has no record of receiving JM1&#x27;s report on those dates.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">On 1 February 2012, notice was given by e-mail that Adif had introduced temporary speed limits on both tracks from PK 77+365 to PK 80+278 of the Ourense-Santiago line (082).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">On 6 March 2012 the seventh meeting of the monitoring group of the Class 121 rolling stock in operation in Galicia, Aragón and Catalunya took place. Point 6 of the minutes, &#x27;Braking curve adjusted to changeover from ERTMS to ASFA&#x27; states &#x27;Adif has introduced a temporary speed limit, which has solved the problem from the operational viewpoint....

The problem was solved by setting up temporary speed limits. All this formed part of the business of the meetings which were being held on the operation of the Class 121 rolling stock. There is no record that JM1&#x27;s second comment was passed on to Adif: his warning of the danger of the curve itself.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">On the other hand, as commented in previous sections (3.2.3.3.2), the Renfe Operadora SMS does include organs for participation in safety management. Among these are the six Regional Traffic Safety Committees (CTSCs) - one for each region. One of these is León regional CTSC, which includes the area of the North East Management (including Galicia).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">As it happens, JP1 and his subordinate JM1 attended the meetings of that Regional Traffic Safety Committee. Information about this was requested from Renfe Operadora. JM1 attended 36 of the 43 meetings of that committee from 2005.

The aim was to connect the line to the rest of the rail network on the Iberian gauge.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Consideration was also given to installing ERTMS between these two gauge changers. This system therefore extended to Santiago de Compostela station, although it only covered the new tracks laid out.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">This means that the standard gauge tracks planned between the Ourense gauge changer and that at Santiago de Compostela station are governed by ERTMS from CRC at Madrid-Atocha, whereas the other tracks continue to be managed via the various interlocking systems (from Ourense and Santiago) which incorporate ASFA.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The changeovers between the ERTMS installed on the new, standard-gauge tracks and the ASFA system present on the conventional gauge tracks at Ourense and Santiago de Compostela stations were planned at these gauge changers, using the manoeuvres to change the gauges of the trains.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Construction works</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The contract for the track formation works on the Ourense-Santiago leg, on the section giving access to Santiago de Compostela station, was awarded in July 2009.

The originally planned gauge changers were cancelled, because two gauge changeovers in just 90 km would seriously erode the time savings achieved by the new section. In future, when standard gauge might be available on other, basically southward, stretches, the switch would be made to this gauge with multi-purpose sleepers available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td colspan="2">Page 66 of 110</td></tr></table>

It no longer entered single track at Santiago. Instead, connection was possible with the Eje Atlántico towards Vigo (line 824) without the need for manoeuvres at Santiago de Compostela station. However, the A Grandeira and Río Sar (line 842) branches had to be available for this purpose.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Thus, in June 2010, the initially planned solution was reconsidered. A proposal was made in October 2010 to modify it. The Ministry of Development authorised this in April 2011.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">This decision necessitated a change of plan, mainly to the safety and communication installations (ERTMS and ASFA location), track assembly (sleepers and track gear) and electrification (catenary).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">As regards the signalling and control installations, given that the new gauge allowed movements to/from other existing lines managed by the Santiago interlocking system, it was arranged that this interlocking system would also manage the section of this new line where it accessed Santiago de Compostela, plus the A Grandeira and Río Sar branches. As commented, this access section had ASFA, not ERTMS.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">It was therefore necessary to set the new boundaries of management of the interlocking system of Santiago de Compostela station (and the boundaries at Ourense). This would now include governance of the access sections to the new line and its interconnections with the existing tracks.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Further thought then had to be given to the locations of the changeovers between the ERTMS safety system planned on the new line and the ASFA system on the conventional rail network. So far these changeovers had been provided at the planned gauge changeovers. Now, the new boundaries were set between both systems on the new build line (082).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">These changeovers must comply with the Adif standard &#x27;Functional Requirements and Engineering Rules for ERTMS L1 and L2. Version 2.4.0 dated 22/10/2009&#x27;. More specifically, section 5.2.6 &#x27;Changeover from ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 to ASFA&#x27; states that changeovers to ASFA must be announced and arranged on the route, and always before a caution signal.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">As the Santiago de Compostela interlocking system includes the bypass A Grandeira branch (and the Río Sar branch), it was then necessary to position this changeover in the Ourense - Santiago direction before the caution signals E&#x27;7 (for track 1) and E&#x27;9 (for track 2). Both of these are located at PK 80+619. Hence, in deference to the standard, the changeover was located at PK 80+069 (actual PK; the PK 80+169 in the project).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The arrangements for changeover from ASFA to ERTMS are established in section 5.2.5: &#x27;Changeover from ASFA to ERTMS/ETCS Level 1&#x27; of the standard. It states that the order to change to level 1 must be given in a group of fixed signal balises. Thus, in the opposite direction, Santiago - Ourense, on the access tracks to Santiago the changeover was made at signals 844 (track 1) and 842 (track 2), the first signals located after the bypass of A Grandeira branch, at PK 84+200.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td colspan="2">Page 67 of 110</td></tr></table>

Basically, level I records safety parameters; level II ride comfort; and III track fatigue via the rail (vertical, lateral and rolling contact fatigue) and track gauge.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Dynamic monitoring can be performed on specialist vehicles or on the rolling stock in service, at operating speed. This generally takes place quarterly and is an indirect method of finding out the condition of the track. It measures the accelerations to which the vehicle is exposed in given zones, by positioning accelerometers at strategic points.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Dynamic monitoring measures transverse (or lateral) acceleration on bogies (or wheelsets, as in this case), which is associated with static or dynamic warping and misalignments with a short wavelength. It also detects vertical acceleration on the axle box, which is associated with short-wave levelling defects on each rail (welds, slipping etc.), and lateral and vertical acceleration on the vehicle shell (body), which is associated with long-wave levelling defects and misalignment which affect passenger comfort. Finally, it detects uncompensated lateral acceleration.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">In the accident zone, the last geometric monitoring (before the accident) took place on 21 November 2012. The readings for all parameters were good, except a small levelling defect (low point) which could hardly be classed &#x27;ZUT&#x27; (a zone requiring urgent attention).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">This low point was located towards PK 84+245, at the start of the Angrois bend, and corresponded to the transition wedge of the first pier of viaduct E-01 (in the direction of travel of the train involved in the accident). It was repaired in December 2012.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The last dynamic monitoring took place on 8 May 2013. It used specialist vehicle BT-2, which confirmed the good condition of the track. All the acceleration values measured on the vehicle were far from the minimum monitoring thresholds and well in excess of the values for scheduled or urgent intervention.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Annex 3.4.2.3 contains the data from the geometric monitoring (analysis I) carried out in November 2011 and the dynamic monitoring carried out in May 2012.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td colspan="2">Page 75 of 110</td></tr></table>

On the other hand, significant fluctuations were apparent in some of the measured parameters (curvature) up to PK 85.2. These were attributable to the diverging route of the bypass track at crossover B1-B3 at A Grandeira branch, after the Angrois bend.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The record of the dynamic monitoring shows (from the top down): lateral acceleration measured on both wheels on the same side; vertical acceleration measured on the axle boxes of the two wheels on both sides; lateral and vertical acceleration on the box (of one of the coaches); and unbalanced acceleration. The kilometre count in this case does correspond to reality. New and larger fluctuations emerge in some of the accelerations, though they are not of significant value. They were attributed to transit of the straight track at the existing bypasses (B1-B3) at the A Grandeira branch after the Angrois bend.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">3.4.2.4. Measurement of track data</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">After the event, in the morning of 25 July 2013, safety technicians from Renfe Operadora and Adif, in the presence of CIAF members, proceeded to measure various track parameters in the derailment zone.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">They measured the track from point 0 (beginning of derailment - PK 84+413) forwards for 15 m and backwards for 35 m (normally this is only done for 15 m). They measured the values for track gauge and cant, metre by metre. This interval also fell entirely within the transition curve (clothoid) leading to the 402 m circular curve (the Angrois bend).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Annex 3.4.2.4 contains the sheet of measured track data.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">With regard to track gauge, the theoretical value is 1668 mm. Standard NAV 7.3.2.0 - Track qualification: track gauge sets maximum tolerances of -3 mm and +15 mm for the theoretical value for curves of radius greater than or equal to 400 m. The measurement on location found values ranging from -0.1 to +0.9 mm in the 15 m after point 0. On the 35 m before, the values ranged from 0 to +2.3 mm. The track gauge values were therefore within tolerance.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">For track gauge variation, the same standard allows a tolerance of 2 mm between successive sleepers. This implies 3.33 mm/m (for speeds greater than 60 km/h). Here, the maximum variations measured were 1 mm (between points +9 and +10) and 1.6 mm (between points -29 and -30), relating to the sections before and after point 0 respectively.

Since this is the transition zone, it increases steadily up to 130 mm on the circular curve. Standard NAV 7.3.5.0 - Track qualification: cant, warping and sleeper stability/ sets maximum tolerances of + 10 mm for the theoretical value, for speeds below 120 km/h.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The measurement carried out at the site found values greater than permitted on the section after point 0, which reached -46.2 mm at point +15. This is logical as a result of the derailment. On the section before, the values range from -4.2 mm (at point -33) to -7.9 mm (at point 0). The cant values were therefore within tolerance.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">For cant variation (warping), the same standard permits a tolerance of 6 mm per 3 metres, for speeds less than 120 km/h. The measurement at the site found values greater than permitted on the 15 m section after point 0. This made sense as a result of the derailment. On the section before, the cant variation was no higher than 2.3 mm per 3 m, which was therefore within tolerance.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The rail cross section was also measured at three points (84+176: signal E7; 84+230: start of curve; and 84+413: point 0). The purpose was to check for the presence of possible fatigue. This was a new rail (in service since 2011), grade 60 kg/m, and was found to have maintained its theoretical dimensions.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">3.4.2.5. Verification of maximum permitted speed admissible on Angrois bend and fixed signalling in the zone</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">A plane survey was carried out on location on the Angrois bend. This confirmed its layout parameters. After a straight section, the curve begins at PK 84+228. A first section of curve represents a 200 m transition, in the form of a clothoid where parameter A = 283.8. This ends at PK 84+428, the start of the circular curve 402 m in radius and 265 m in length. This ends at PK 84+693, where another transition section, similar to the first, begins. This is 200 m in length and has a clothoid of parameter A = 283.8 ending at PK 84+893, where a straight begins.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The curve has a 130 mm cant, so that the variation in the transition zones is 0.65 mm/m. Both values are normal. As there is an 80 km/h speed limit on the curve, the unbalanced acceleration (Asc) obtained for that speed is 0.50 m/s², below the normally established value for type N (normal) trains, which is 0.65 m/s². The latter value would be reached at a speed of 85 km/h.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Considering the 8 mm cant deficiency found by the measurement on location in the transition zone (in the immediate vicinity of point 0), the actual cant on the curve would be 122 mm (theoretical: 130 mm), giving rise to an unbalanced acceleration of 0.54 m/s². That value is still below the permitted maximum (0.65 m/s²).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Nevertheless, the dynamic monitoring commented on in a previous section took place at 72 km/h while taking the Angrois bend. It resulted in an unbalanced acceleration of 0.26 m/s², consistent with the presence of an actual cant of 130 mm.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td colspan="2">Page 77 of 110</td></tr></table>

This contains special requirements for running Class 730 and other locomotives on RFIG lines. It allows a double rake to run with up to 12 axles with brake overridden (six for a single rake), although there is a speed limit. This does not apply if a brake is not available on just one axle.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">After the two rakes (013 and 012) were uncoupled at Ourense, the brake tests of both were repeated. According to the recorder for rake 013, the test took place at around 20:00 hours, before departure for Pontevedra, and showed that one axle still had a brake overridden. Logically, this was the one detected in Madrid. The recorder for rake 012 shows that the brake test was also carried out at around 20:00 hours, and that it had brakes on all its axles. There was no sign of a brake overridden on any axle.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Annex 3.4.3.5 contains the safety recorder data. It shows that one brake was unavailable on one axle at Madrid and Ourense.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">3.4.3.5.2. Brake check in situ</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Train 150/151, consisting of rake 730.012, carried out emergency braking on 24 July 2013, near the Angrois bend moments before the accident. The data from the safety recorder, located on power car 045, which was running in position 1 as power car, show that this braking began by the driver operating the service brake handle, by moving it to the emergency position (rapid braking).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">According to information from Talgo (diagnosis), the figures obtained from the record of the train&#x27;s technical parameters show that, at the time the emergency brake was applied, the train was moving at a pre-set speed. Therefore, when it entered a 12.5‰ slope, traction did not apply and the electric brake was applied lightly. This took place automatically, to counter the effects of the slope in order not to exceed the pre-set speed.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">On the section between the time of application of the emergency brake (PK 84+009) until the derailment occurred (PK 84+413), the train&#x27;s braking curve has been compared with the following two curves: braking curve under the conditions set by the Rolling Stock Technical Specification for Interoperability (TSI) and the braking curve most similar to the actual curve from the tests carried out during approval of the Class 730 rolling stock.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">These two curves have been adjusted to the conditions under which rake 730.012 was running on the day of the accident. This means they have been corrected to take account of wheel diameter, train loading and longitudinal track profile (slope/incline).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">It can be deduced from this comparison that the behaviour of rake 730.012 during the emergency braking prior to the accident matches the description for braking curves in the TSI and in the approval of the Class 730 rolling stock. Hence the braking performance was correct.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td colspan="2">Page 85 of 110</td></tr></table>

The system delayed three seconds before actually braking. Hence it was 20:41:02, speed 195 km/h (at PK 84+171), when deceleration began. The train left the rails (point 0) at 20:41:06 (four seconds later) while moving at 179 km/h (at PK 84+413).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">In the four seconds of effective braking, a distance of 242 m was covered and the speed was reduced by 16 km/h. This resulted in deceleration of 1.11 m/s². This value, plus the equivalent three seconds (delay in actual application of the brake), conform to the provisions of the Rolling Stock TSI (decision 2008/232/EC, table 7, box A).

Withdrawal of authorisation to run Class 730 rolling stock on ERTMS between Ourense and Santiago de Compostela</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">To function correctly, a safety system, whether ASFA or ERTMS, must not only be correctly installed, both on the track and in the train, but the versions must be mutually compatible.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Article 15 of Directive 2008/57 on the interoperability of the rail system within the Community provides that the Member States shall authorise the placing in service of structural subsystems, checking the technical compatibility of these subsystems with the system into which they are being integrated.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">With reference to the Command/Control and Signalling subsystem, Spain therefore carries out &#x27;integration tests&#x27;, previously called &#x27;supplementary tests&#x27;, which seek to verify the technical compatibility of the train with the network. This is not a validation either of track equipment or of the train&#x27;s on-board equipment.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Thus the complementary tests of the Class 730 units on line 082 took place to analyse the train-track integration of the ERTMS L1. They were carried out in February 2012 on different parts of line 082.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">More specifically, the tests relating to the changeover from level STM EBICAB (with ASFA functionality) to ERTMS L1 took place on track 2, towards Ourense, at the first group of balises on the Santiago side.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Commercial service on the new line 082 between Ourense and Santiago de Compostela began on 10 December 2011. Initially the Madrid-A Coruña link was still served by make-ups consisting of a diesel locomotive and Talgo coaches, as serving on the conventional line. Since this rolling stock did not have on-board ERTMS, it ran under cover of ASFA Digital.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">From 16 June 2012, this rolling stock was replaced with Class 730 railcar trains. These only ran for a week with ERTMS switched on. Then, in the early days of service, problems were detected with the on-board ERTMS which had not been noticed during the complementary testing in February 2012.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td colspan="2">Page 86 of 110</td></tr></table>

This meant that, for one-fifth of the distance of line 082, the train was travelling in &#x27;driver&#x27;s responsibility&#x27; mode, without the complete supervision of ERTMS and without the protection of ASFA. This had traffic safety implications.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">That is why, on 23 June 2012, Renfe Operadora applied to Adif for authorisation for those trains on line 082 to return to their previous conditions of travel, i.e. with ASFA Digital. This authorisation was granted on 25 June 2012.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">To correct the reported defects and enable this rolling stock to use line 082 with ERTMS, the manufacturer (Bombardier) developed a new version of the software (version 3.1.1.2). It delivered the documentation for this to Renfe Operadora in November 2012. Renfe Operadora arranged to carry out the relevant trials on the track to check that it performed properly. The trials were carried out, with a positive outcome, until April 2013.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Although the risk had been minimised, it was still possible that the balises might not be read. Hence the manufacturer&#x27;s proposed solution was to disable another of the on-board safety systems (EBICAB-ATP). This is being studied (March 2014).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">While it is possible that the rolling stock involved in the accident might have travelled with ERTMS in its current configuration and extent (up to PK 80+069), this system would not have limited the speed of entry to the Angrois bend because, from that point, it could travel at 200 km/h with ASFA. It would still have been up to the driver to reduce speed, although he would have had to press the button recognising exit from ERTMS on the cab DMI screen. In theory, this would have been one more factor calling for attention during driving. If this had not been activated, the system would have applied the service brake, which would have been released at the time of pressing the button.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Annex 3.4.3.6 contains Renfe Operadora&#x27;s application to run on ASFA and Adif&#x27;s authorisation to do so.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">3.4.3.7.

Approved contractors had carried out all servicing required by that plan, at authorised centres.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The fault logs for the tractor units of the trainset involved in the accident contained no notes of outstanding brake defects.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The figures for running the whole make-up were within the limits set by the maintenance plan and by the regulations.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The brake test, carried out at Ourense, showed that rake 012, involved in the accident, had braking on all its axles and wheelsets. An estimate of the deceleration achieved by the emergency braking, carried out moments before the derailment, yields values commensurate with the provisions of the Rolling Stock TSI.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Due to ERTMS problems from June 2012, the rolling stock was authorised to run with the ASFA Digital system switched on throughout the length of line 082. ERTMS was not active at any time on the Ourense-Santiago stretch. The train was therefore running under cover of lateral signal blocking, at the then maximum permitted speed of 200 km/h. This was still so in March 2014.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Therefore the decision taken at the time to modify the physical extent of the ERTMS bore no direct relation to the specific causes established for this accident. The incompatibilities which obliged this train to travel on BSL and ASFA might have arisen even if the ERTMS had covered Santiago de Compostela station.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">While it is possible that the rolling stock involved in the accident could have travelled with ERTMS at its current extent (up to PK 80+069) and configuration, this system would not have limited the speed of entry to the Angrois bend. This was because, from that point, the train could travel at 200 km/h with ASFA. It was the driver who had to reduce speed, although he would have to have noticed in the cab that the train had left the ERTMS. Theoretically, this would have been one more factor focusing his attention on driving. If this had gone unnoticed, the system would have turned on the brakes.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The data log from the safety recorder on the head locomotive of the train involved in the accident makes it clear that it left Ourense four minutes late, at 20:05 hours. It was travelling normally, reaching its maximum speed of 200 km/h around 20:23 hours, having passed all signals at green.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">It did not start braking at PK 80+619 (signal E&#x27;7 to adjust to the 80 km/h limit at PK 84+230 - start of the Angrois bend). Instead, it maintained a speed of nearly 200 km/h up to PK 84+009. Here, the emergency brake was applied. It entered the Angrois bend practically at this speed. It was derailed</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td colspan="2">Page 102 of 110</td></tr></table>

This was in breach of the train timetable and the Maximum Speed Table.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The cab audio recording made by the safety recorder in the front power car of the train in the accident is corroborated by the driver&#x27;s and the train manager&#x27;s statements. It shows that a (corporate) mobile telephone call from the train manager to the driver started at 20:39:15 hours (towards PK 78+280, and near signal E&#x27;7 - PK 80+619 - the point where braking normally commences). The call lasted 100 seconds and was about stopping at the station at Puentedeume (between A Coruña and Ferrol).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The conversation is over-long (100 s), since there was no emergency. It did not use the train&#x27;s internal intercoms. Furthermore, its content was repetitive. Given the train manager&#x27;s (presumed) insistence, the driver makes the same reply three times: that the train will certainly fit on to either of the tracks at Puentedeume station.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">In this whole duration there was a considerable length of track (5 540 m) on which he did not carry out part of the normal driving activity. He did not begin reducing speed at the usual place (E&#x27;7, which he passed 43 seconds after the start of the call), but maintained speed (200 km/h). He did not notice the change of ASFA mode in the cab (from high-speed to conventional), which he passed three seconds later.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The only existing regulations on the use of electronic devices (mainly mobile phones, but also others) on the date of the accident was Notice 102 of 1997, issued by the former RENFE, and a 2011 recommendation by Renfe Operadora. Neither had the status of a rule or regulation (Recommendation 6).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">In this Commission&#x27;s experience of investigating incidents, this has been the first time that a cab audio recording has been available. This has given a much more thorough picture of the driver&#x27;s behaviour, attitude, activity and interfaces (human and machine). Hence it would be worth studying the possibility of gradually fitting this type of recording to the other rolling stock.

The driver was in breach of the requirement of the timetable book for train 150/151 and the maximum speed table for line 082.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">As a contributory cause, we note that the driver was distracted by answering an internal telephone call from the train manager on his own train, which explains why he did not brake hard enough to reduce speed before entering that curve.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">4.4. FURTHER FINDINGS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Minor discrepancies have been found between the set timetable for train 150/151, the Maximum Speed Table for line 082 and the practical arrangements (relating to the scope of the ERTMS). These discrepancies are unrelated to the accident causes.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">5. MEASURES ADOPTED</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">5.1. GENERAL MEASURES</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">5.1.1.

As of March 2014 the list of these measures, including action on the CIAF preliminary recommendations referred to above, was as follows:</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">1.- Revise the maximum speed tables for all lines, with speed graduation analysis, and setting criteria for variation of the maximum speeds.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Those tables, and the existing speed transitions, have been revised. A definition has been reached for a &#x27;significant change of speed&#x27;, which has been detected at 375 points on the Adif network (51 on high-speed lines and 324 on the conventional network).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">2.- Revise the signalling on the track of the lines identified by the above analysis, which are not marked with any other type of sign. This will be done by signs warning of a change of speed, and of the commencement of that speed.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Signs have already been set up at 122 significant changes of speed, where the speed difference is at least 40% of the lower speed. These are either on high-speed lines (37) or on lines belonging to the conventional network with maximum speed over 160 km/h (85).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">3.- Provide protection, by means of a set of ASFA balises, on the sections where there is a significant reduction of the maximum speed, like the protection for temporary speed limits on the track.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The 122 significant changes of speed above already have balises.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">4.- Work with the industry to promote further development of ASFA Digital so that it has greater capacity to transmit information from track to train, allows greater versatility, and offers the possibility of transmitting voice signals in addition to acoustic signals, as at present.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The development framework for ASFA Digital (already fitted to most rolling stock) includes a plan for on-track trials of the new prototype 11-frequency balise (analogue ASFA currently offers five). Some of the new frequencies will be allocated to speed control.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">5.- Analyse the engineering rules of the technical procedures for transition from ERTMS to ASFA.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">This measure has already been finalised. The applicable rules have been reviewed and analysed, in addition to the conditions on which each existing transition is carried out in the infrastructure. The study was limited to scheduled and automatic transitions between ERTMS Level 1 and ASFA. It did not include manual transitions or transitions degraded due to malfunctioning.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">6.- Explore in depth the possibility of installing a satellite system for trains as back-up to the signalling systems.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">ERA-2014-0070-00-00-ESEN</td><td style='text-align: center;'>Page 105 of 110</td></tr></table>
